# Tata-Group-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights

I recently participated in Tata's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a consulting team at Tata.

I worked on a project to help a retail client review their revenue data to prepare for the future. I created data visuals, practiced using Tableau to represent information, and built my presentation skills in a real-world context.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on strategic problems for clients and I'm excited to apply these skills on a consulting team at a company like Tata.
